# Jupyter netbooks for the "Big data with Pandas & Dask: the real example" post
These notebooks are thought to be followed with this
[blog post](https://www.bustawin.com). Each notebook
represents a section of the blog.

## Requirements
[Just install jupyter](https://jupyter.org/install).

## Running
1. Execute `jupyter-lab` in this directory.
2. Run the jupyter notebook starting with `1 looping...` while reading the first section of the blog post.
3. Run the jupyter notebook starting with `2 use...` while reading the second section.
4. Guess what to do for the notebook starting with `3 Dask...` :-)
